PRD (Product Requirements Document) â€” is a document that describes the product requirements. It serves as the basis for developing and creating a new product or improving an existing one. The PRD contains a detailed description of the product's functionality, features, and objectives, as well as the expectations for its usage.

### Main Components of a PRD:

1. **Purpose and Context**:
   - **Product Purpose**: A description of what the product should do and the problems it should solve.
   - **Context**: A description of the current market conditions, competitors, and user needs.

2. **User Description**:
   - **Target Audience**: A description of the users for whom the product is intended.
   - **Personas**: Detailed profiles of typical users, including their needs, goals, and challenges.

3. **Functional Requirements**:
   - **Core Functions**: A description of the key functions and capabilities of the product.
   - **User Scenarios**: A description of the product usage scenarios, including the steps that users will take to achieve their goals.

4. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - **Performance**: Requirements for the speed and performance of the product.
   - **Security**: Requirements for data security and protection against unauthorized access.
   - **Scalability**: Requirements for the product's ability to scale to support a larger number of users or increased data.

5. **Technical Requirements**:
   - **Architecture**: A description of the architectural solutions and technologies that will be used.
   - **Integrations**: A description of the external systems and services with which the product should interact.

6. **Success Metrics**:
   - **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: The metrics by which the success of the product will be evaluated.
   - **Goals**: The specific objectives that the product should achieve (e.g., number of users, level of user satisfaction).

7. **Risks and Constraints**:
   - **Risks**: A description of potential risks and issues that may arise during the development and use of the product.
   - **Constraints**: A description of limitations, such as budget constraints, timelines, or technical limitations.

8. **Development Plan**:
   - **Development Phases**: A description of the main stages of development and their timelines.
   - **Resources**: A description of the necessary resources, including the development team, tools, and technologies.

### Conclusion
The PRD is an important document that helps the development team and other stakeholders understand exactly what needs to be created, which requirements must be met, and how the product's success will be evaluated. It serves as the foundation for planning, developing, and testing the product, ensuring that all project participants work towards achieving common goals.
