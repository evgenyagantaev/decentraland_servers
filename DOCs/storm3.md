Below is an attempt to brainstorm ideas and potential directions for developing this concept:

1. **Conceptual Justification and Usefulness**  
   - **Why might this be needed?**  
     - A decentralized platform for crowdsourcing code (specifically Solidity solutions), where developers, contributors, AI agents, etc. compete to write correct code that meets an open set of requirements (tests).  
     - Motivation to produce high-quality code that passes tests and verification.  
     - Reduction of transaction costs in finding contractors: there is no need to conduct tenders/off-chain negotiations, everything takes place on the platform.

   - **Key Value Proposition**:  
     - Accelerating the development process of smart contracts by rewarding the participants who first provide the correct implementation.  
     - Enabling third parties to verify/deploy code that has already passed tests and been confirmed by validators.

2. **Technical Details and Future Directions**  
   1. **Standard Execution Environment**  
      - It is necessary to fix compiler versions (Solidity), the environment (e.g., Truffle/Hardhat), Node.js, etc.  
      - Options:  
        - **On-chain verification** using zk-SNARKs/zkVM (currently too cumbersome, but a promising direction).  
        - **Off-chain verification** in specific validator nodes with a standard environment.  
      - Question: how can the environment be updated to support new versions of Solidity without breaking compatibility? One option is a mechanism of "hardforks" or governance procedures within the meta-blockchain.

   2. **Structure for Storing Tests**  
      - JS tests can be quite voluminous. Storing everything on Ethereum's on-chain storage is expensive.  
      - Idea: store tests with an IPFS hash link. In the meta-blockchain, only the hash is recorded.  
      - For reproduction or validator verification, validators must be able to retrieve the code and tests from IPFS.  
      - Advantage: this way, the blockchain is not heavily burdened; it only stores a link and its hash for verification.

   3. **Execution Order**  
      - A transaction in the meta-blockchain states: "I, as the initiator, am posting a pool of tests (with an IPFS hash), specifying a reward (in ETH, deposited in an integrated smart contract), and looking for executors."  
      - Any participant can respond: "I have code that passes all the tests."  
      - Then, validators (validator pools) take the code, compile it, and run the tests.  
      - The first confirmation (tests passed plus validator consensus) leads to the closure of the request and the payment of the reward.

   4. **Ensuring Validator Integrity**  
      - To prevent "arbitrary rejection" of results or "collusion," it is sufficient to run multiple independent validators.  
      - The consensus could be similar to Ethereum's PoS algorithm, where a majority is required to include results in a block, and dissenting validators face slashing (penalties).  
      - Storing test results/logs: it may be necessary to at least store hash logs of the results so that tests can be rechecked and dissenting validator outcomes can be excluded if needed.

   5. **Challenges with Test Complexity**  
      - Tests might be too lengthy/voluminous, which will require significant computational time and could be expensive for validators.  
      - Possible solutions:  
        - Limit the size of tests by duration or quantity.  
        - Benchmark model: the initiator specifies an upper-bound on testing time in the standard environment, and if tests exceed this limit, the submission is rejected.  
        - Use phased payments for executing tests: validators may receive additional compensation from the network for high volumes of computations.  
      - There is also a potential branch of development towards "zero-knowledge proofs" (zkProof), though this is difficult to implement for JS tests.

   6. **Possible Bidding and Competition Mechanics**  
      - The initiator could increase the "transaction fee" if a suitable solution does not emerge for a long time (i.e., if few are willing to take on the task).  
      - However, it is worth considering whether there should be a time limit; for example, if no solution is provided within 30 days, the transaction could "burn" or be reverted.  
      - Reward pool mechanics: a participant may contribute to the reward jointly with others. For example, several interested parties desiring the same solution can pool their resources.

   7. **Protection Against "Code Stealing"**  
      - There is a risk that someone might develop an almost correct solution, but slightly fall short, and another participant could copy and refine it into a complete solution. The question is: should submitted solutions remain off-chain until validators confirm that the tests have passed, or should an "open" model be used (where all solutions are public)?  
      - An option is encrypted submission of solutions directly to validators (e.g., via commit-reveal).  
        - Initially, the participant publishes a hash of their code archive (commit). Then, after the deadline or once a sufficient number of commits have been collected, participants reveal their solutions.  
        - This approach addresses the risk of code copying.

   8. **Scalability and a Dedicated "Secondary Network"**  
      - Essentially, this functions as a Layer 2 solution or an additional protocol layered on top of Ethereum. A proprietary token could be issued to pay validators, or the system could continue to use ETH.  
      - To ensure greater throughput, the core logic could run on L2 (e.g., zkRollups, Optimistic Rollups), with final results being settled on Ethereum.  
      - This would alleviate the load on the primary network.

3. **User Use Cases**  
   1. **Decentralized Bounty Programs**  
      - Developers from DeFi/DAO protocols can publish "requirements" (tests) for modules of their smart contracts, and the community submits implementations.  
      - The winner (the first to have a solution that passes all tests) receives the reward.

   2. **Automation of Routine Development**  
      - AI agents (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) can be used to semi-automatically generate smart contracts that pass tests.  
      - This creates a "pipeline" for rapid development and validation if the reward justifies the computational costs.

   3. **Audit/Security Verification**  
      - Not only functional tests but also a set of security tests (e.g., checks for vulnerabilities like reentrancy, overflow) can be published.  
      - The meta-blockchain becomes a platform for locating secure implementations.

   4. **DAO Governance**  
      - The question arises: how can the rules be updated within the meta-blockchain? For instance, how does one vote on updating the standard testing environment?  
      - A built-in DAO mechanism can be implemented: stakeholders or participants in the validation process decide when and how to update the environment.

4. **Risks and Challenges**  
   - **Legal Rights Issues**: What intellectual property rights are transferred when the code is "uploaded" to the blockchain? Considerations such as licensing come into play.  
   - **Fraud**: There is a risk of unauthorized access to others' tests and the potential for code theft. This can partially be mitigated through commit-reveal mechanisms.  
   - **Development Complexity**: It will be necessary to implement a rather complex validation protocol (e.g., determining how to cache the environment, generate Docker images, etc.).  
   - **Economic Model**: The economic design must ensure that it is profitable for executors to participate, that initiators pay a reasonable fee, and that validators are compensated for their work. This might require separate tokens or subsidy mechanisms.

5. **Additional Expansion Ideas**  
   1. **Quality Metrics for Solutions**  
      - Beyond the binary pass/fail outcome of tests, metrics for efficiency (e.g., gas usage, execution time, code conciseness) could be introduced.  
      - The initiator could rank solutions and award bonuses for minimal gas consumption.  
      - An auction model might be implemented: "Write a contract that passes the tests and has the lowest execution cost for the function `f()`. The solution with the lowest `gasUsed` wins."

   2. **Ongoing Code Maintenance**  
      - If the code requires improvements after publication, new transactions could be initiated for enhancements (with new tests).  
      - A versioning system could be integrated: the contract may have multiple versions, each of which passes a new set of tests, and the deployment takes into account the historical progression.

   3. **Decentralized Order Exchange**  
      - A public "task catalog" could be created listing all active bounties (transactions), ranked by reward size, difficulty, and popularity.  
      - Executors could build profiles, ratings, and a history of successful implementations.

   4. **Staking and Insurance**  
      - An insurance mechanism might be established: if validators erroneously confirm a solution, honest participants should have an opportunity to dispute it. This might require a deposit to initiate a review process.  
      - A mutual insurance pool could also be set up to protect validators against accidental failures or hacking attacks.

### Summary

- **Advantages**:  
  Stimulates decentralized smart contract development by rewarding those who first deliver a correct solution and by automating the verification process through tests.

- **Challenges**:  
  - The economic model must be carefully designed to ensure that all participants (initiators, executors, validators) are incented appropriately.  
  - Technically, it is challenging to implement a reliable decentralized testing environment that supports updates to the environment and includes a penalty system.  
  - Storage of code/tests will likely need to be off-chain with only hash references maintained on-chain.  
  - The potential use of commit-reveal mechanisms to protect executors from having their solutions copied.

Overall, the idea presents an intriguing bounty/crowdsourcing protocol for contracts, where the "work contract" is formalized through a set of unit tests and rewards are automated upon the successful passage of these tests. The key lies in working out the technical details (especially validation) and achieving economic balance.
