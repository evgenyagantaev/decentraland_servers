Correct. At the MVP stage, most likely the **core logic related to profile filtering and semantics will be handled off-chain.** For the smart contract itself, your NFT profiles will primarily serve as unique identifiers (tokenized profiles).

Here's how it typically works at the MVP stage:

**Smart Contract (MVP Focus):**

* **NFT Creation (Minting):** The main function of the contract is to enable the creation of new NFT profiles. Most likely, the contract will store only the minimal information necessary for identifying and owning the NFT.
* **NFT Depositing:** A function to record that the NFT profile is "active" on the platform and available for viewing. This can simply be a record indicating that an NFT with a specific ID has been "deposited" into the contract.
* **Ownership Management:** The smart contract will track the owners of the NFT profiles.
* **(Possibly) Basic Metadata Linking:** The contract will contain a URI (link) to the NFT metadata (for example, on IPFS). It *will not* interpret the content of this metadata.

**Off-chain Infrastructure (Frontend/Backend - Main MVP Logic):**

* **Metadata Storage:** The metadata for the profiles (role, link to resume/requirements, skills, etc.) will be stored off-chain, for instance on IPFS.
* **Metadata Indexing:** For effective filtering and search, the metadata will need to be indexed. This can be implemented using tools such as The Graph, Covalent API, Alchemy Notify, or custom backend solutions.
* **Frontend (UI):** The user interface will interact with the backend to retrieve the list of deposited NFTs and their corresponding metadata.
* **Filtering and Search Logic:** All logic for filtering by roles, skills, keywords in resumes/requirements, and more will be implemented on the backend or directly in the frontend application, utilizing the indexed metadata.

**Why this approach for an MVP?**

* **Simplicity and Speed of Development:** Developing and auditing a simple smart contract that only manages NFTs is significantly faster and simpler than a complex contract that attempts to process and filter data.
* **Reduced Gas Costs:** Transactions with a simple smart contract tend to be less expensive.
* **Flexibility in Changing Logic:** Filtering and search logic on the off-chain level is much easier to modify and update than smart contract logic, which requires deploying new versions.
* **Handling Complex Data:** Smart contracts are not well suited for processing large volumes of text data and complex search algorithms.

**In the future, as the platform evolves, you may consider moving some of the logic into the smart contract, for example:**

* **Basic On-chain Filtering:** You could add simple role filtering directly within the contract.
* **On-chain Reputation System:** Ratings and reviews might be stored and updated directly in the smart contract.
* **More Complex Interaction Logic:** For instance, mechanisms for proposal requests or an escrow service.

**Thus, for an MVP, your strategy is completely logical and follows a common approach.** You focus on creating and managing NFT profiles on the blockchain, while delegating the more complex data processing and interaction logic to the off-chain environment for enhanced flexibility and faster development.

This approach will allow you to quickly launch the platform's basic functionality and gather user feedback before investing in more complex and costly on-chain solutions.
